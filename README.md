## Hi, I'm Double Dot Studios! 👋

I am the developer of the *quartz* notes app and run the DoubleDotStudios YouTube channel.

I use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) \(an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) based distro) with the [Budgie Desktop](https://buddiesofbudgie.org/), [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Tokyonight-GTK-Theme)
and [Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com/) as my themes for my entire setup!
